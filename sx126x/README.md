# SX126x SDK

The SX126x SDK contains several simple examples for SX126x transceivers.

A further demonstration of the LR-FHSS capability of the chip can be found [here](https://github.com/Lora-net/SWDM001).

## Configuration

Each example has its own set of parameters - see `sx126x/apps/<example>/main_<example>.h`.

There is also a common configuration file `sx126x/common/apps_configuration.h` where parameters can be set, among which:

* Packet type
* RF frequency
* Output power
* Packet and modulation parameters for different modulations

See details in the common [README](common/README.md)

## Requirements

### Supported boards

This SDK is developed on the ST Microeletronic [NUCLEO-L476RG development board](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-l476rg.html)
