A further demonstration of the LR-FHSS capability of the chip can be found [here](https://github.com/Lora-net/SWDM001).

## Configuration

Each example has its own set of parameters - see `lr11xx/apps/<example>/main_<example>.h`.

There is also [a common configuration file](common/apps_configuration.h) where parameters can be set, among which:

* Packet type
* RF frequency
* Output power
* Packet and modulation parameters for different modulations

## Requirements

### Firmware

This SDK requires the transceiver to run the following version

* LR1110: firmware version ([0x0401](https://github.com/Lora-net/radio_firmware_images/tree/master/lr1110/transceiver))
* LR1120: firmware version ([0x0201](https://github.com/Lora-net/radio_firmware_images/tree/master/lr1120/transceiver))
* LR1121: firmware version ([0x0103](https://github.com/Lora-net/radio_firmware_images/tree/master/lr1121/transceiver))

To update the transceiver with the desired firmware version, please use [the updater tool application](https://github.com/Lora-net/SWTL001).

### Workaround

#### High ACP (Adjacent Channel Power)

This issue has beed fixed in firmware LR1110 0x0308 and LR1120 0x0102 - it was not present in LR1121 0x0101. The associated workaround is disabled in this project starting from v2.1.0.

If one wants to re-enable the workaround, this [line](common/apps_common.mk#L33) has to be commented.
