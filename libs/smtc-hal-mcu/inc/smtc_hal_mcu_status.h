/**
 * @brief SMTC HAL MCU status
 *
 * If an API returns with a status SMTC_HAL_MCU_STATUS_OK, it means the related action terminated successfully,
 * respecting all caller provided parameters.
 * If an API returns with a status different from SMTC_HAL_MCU_STATUS_OK, then it means that at least the corresponding
 * error occurred. But the same call may suffer additional error. For instance in the case where an action is called
 * with incorrect parameter, on a resource that has not been initialised, the API will return status
 * SMTC_HAL_MCU_STATUS_BAD_PARAMETERS or SMTC_HAL_MCU_STATUS_NOT_INIT (but not both at the same time).
 * The first erroneous status to be returned is implementation dependant.
